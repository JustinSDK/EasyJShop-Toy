EasyJShop
=========

A simple implementation of an image processor using Java 2D. Written for my girl friend, currently my wife, in 2005.

EasyJShop is an easy image processor. It could help you capture screen, open files and do simple image processing, such as copying or cropping a selection, doing a horizontal or vertical mirror, rotating it clockwise or counter-clockwise.
